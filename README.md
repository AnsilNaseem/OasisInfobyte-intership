### Task 1 
## IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Problem Statement: </br>
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

### Task 2
## UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Problem Statement: 
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

### Task 3
## CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Problem Statement:
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if yoU want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

### Task 4
## EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Problem Statement:
We've all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, Use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, Use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let's get started!
